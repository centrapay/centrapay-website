<p>Create deeper engagement directly with your customers through turning your
physical products into digital ones which can be used as currency to engage
consumers.</p>

<h2 id="case-study-coca-cola">Case Study: Coca-Cola</h2>

<p>When Coca-Cola launched Coca-Cola Zero to the NZ market it wanted to drive brand
awareness and the sampling of new product to its target market – skiers and
snowboarders.</p>

<p>Alpine Media used POCKET Vouchers to deliver a winter sampling and brand
awareness campaign.  Skiers and Snowboarders simply txt Turoa, Whaka or Cadrona
to 393 (POCKET Vouchers dedicated short code).</p>

<p>The objectives were to drive product trial and brand awareness with a txt based
adbloc sampling campaign and selected ski areas.</p>

<p>The campaign was so successful that demand outstripped supply with over 8,000
txts and 68% redemption rate.  In addition, there was significant uplift in
overall sales for each on market café.</p>

<h2 id="case-study-liquorland">Case Study: Liquorland</h2>

<p>Liquorland was the first retail partner in New Zealand that signed on to accept
POCKETvouchers and has experienced strong results since the first promotional
campaign was run. Liquorland has 70+ franchised specialist liquor stores around
New Zealand from Kerikeri to Invercargill.</p>

<p>A POCKETvouchers Payment Type has been built into the Liquorland Point Of Sale
(POS) system, Infinity by Triquestra, to allow seamless voucher redemption. This
was also executed at a head office level and did not require any in-store work,
and allows POCKETvouchers to validate, cancel and track uniquely coded vouchers.</p>

<p>Liquorland worked with key liquor suppliers to curate over 50 POCKETvoucher
campaigns which delivered exceptional results for the individual brands and
increased foot-traffic and incremental sales for the Liquorland franchisees.
Liquorland Marketing Manager Angela Hurst says “POCKETvouchers is a fantastic
mechanism to drive people in store as it prompts a real call to action. These
are often customers who have not shopped at Liquorland stores before so it’s an
opportunity to convert them to shop with us in future and we are always
impressed with the redemption rates and incremental sales the POCKETvoucher
campaigns generate.”</p>

<p>Liquorland built their own customer database so they could communicate special
information and offers. In order to build the database they created an online
sign-up form and consumers were incentivised to sign-up with a POCKETvoucher
for $20 off next time they spend $50 at any Liquorland store. This drove over
20,000 sign-ups in under three weeks which was deemed highly successfully
by Liquorland.</p>
