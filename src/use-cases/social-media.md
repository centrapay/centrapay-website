# Social Media

Create deeper engagement directly with your customers through turning your
physical products into digital ones which can be used as currency to engage
consumers.

## Case Study: Ice  Break

Ice Break Iced Coffee used Facebook to give away free samples of their new
product at launch. The offer drove increased engagement with the Facebook
channel and record-breaking likes and comments for the brand. Use POCKETvouchers
across all your social media channels to drive engagement and foot traffic with
consumers.
